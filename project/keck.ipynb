    "In the close binary system GS2000, a late-type main-sequence star\n",
    "orbits around a compact object surrounded by an accretion disk.\n",
    "GS2000 is a \"soft X-ray transient\" discovered during an outburst\n",
    "of the disk when it became a bright X-ray source due to temporarily\n",
    "increased rate of accretion onto the compact object.\n",
    "The compact object is suspected to be a black hole,\n",
    "but it could also be a neutron star.  Theory suggests that\n",
    "the maximum mass possible for a neutron star is about 3 solar masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use data analysis techniques learned\n",
    "in the lectures to estimate the mass of the compact object\n",
    "in GS2000, and hence to determine if it is likely to be a black hole.\n",
    "To measure the compact object mass, the strategy is to measure\n",
    "the period and orbital velocity of the companion star,\n",
    "and then apply Kepler's law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10-m Keck telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii has been used to\n",
    "obtain 13 spectra of GS2000 at 13 different binary phases.\n",
    "The spectra include light both from the companion star and from\n",
    "the accretion disk.  They were taken a few years after the outburst,\n",
    "when accretion disk had faded considerably, so that the companion star\n",
    "makes a substantial contribution to the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GS2000 is quite faint, spectra are rather noisy\n",
    "even with the CCD spectrograph on the 10m Keck telescope.\n",
    "The H$\\alpha$ emission line from the quiescent accretion disk is readily\n",
    "visible, with a characteristic double-peaked velocity profile.\n",
    "But it is not easy to spot absorption lines from the companion star\n",
    "in the individual spectra.\n",
    "For this reason a cross-correlation analysis is needed to detect\n",
    "the radial velocity of the companion star at each of the 13 phases.\n",
    "A number of bright main sequence stars were observed to provide\n",
    "\"template\" spectra, in which the locations of absorption lines\n",
    "are easily visible.\n",

    "The techniques required have been developed in the lectures and homework sets.\n",
